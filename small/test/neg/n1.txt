The life aquatic had tremendous potential as a spoof on documentaries of the discovery channel stripe and on the older sea-exploration documentaries of Jacques Cousteau. Life Acquatic was distinctly unfunny. With shades of Moby Dick, Steve Zissou (Bill Murray) invites a long time fan who is possibly his son off on a mission to destroy a rare shark that ate a friend. Because of past failures, Captain Zissou can no longer get funding, but the fan, possibly his son agrees to put up his inheritance to support the mission. The crew Captain Zissou has had working for him is so pathetic that they can't crack an oyster much less a joke. Yet they go off into the unknown in search of the shark. Will all be lost or will you sleep through the ending?
