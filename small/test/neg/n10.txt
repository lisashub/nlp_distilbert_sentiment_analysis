unusual cast, but most of the big names remind me of aging mitchum and other icons walking through their later roles, main message being see how bored i am acting in this turkey; suppose that's suppose to be anti-Hollywood snarky, like we don't get excited, we don't do much because we don't care; interesting cast for sure, but all squashed; murray is always laid back but thoughtful sometimes, not doing a fear and loathing impersonation where everything is a snide comment, a i'm so hip i don't care comment; reviews tell the cover story of a paper thin plot, so no need to redo that; but comes off as if a dozen people on something who never talk to each other each concocted 3 vaguely related scenes, and then gave them to a director, and maybe in the end to a writer, both of whom were stumped trying to put them together; overall a waste of time, waste of cast, cringingly slow, disjointed, not funny, not sad, not exciting, stilted, vacuous
