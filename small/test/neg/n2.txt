In this modern age we always have a choice in how to measure things. We can take the high-tech approach or we can go low-tech. As an example, let us refer to a common phrase that we all think we understand, yet so very few of us have ever actually measured. Using the low-tech approach would require two things we already have available to us, a common ruler and any old portable timepiece, be it a wrist watch, a wind-up clock or a battery powered clock. Then we would have only to go outside and hunt around for a while until we found a snail, lay the ruler down next to it and observe the passage of time until we had enough data to compute what a snail's pace is. Or, using the high-tech method, we could go see this movie, with its tens of millions of dollars expended on marvelous cameras and the latest in lighting, and I guess some CGI too. This method would also reveal the meaning of snail's pace although it would cost us money and an interminable amount of our time. But at least it would give this film some purpose, a slight usefulness that it lacks standing on its own. It's your choice, but I recommend the ruler-and-watch method. It's cheaper, faster and a lot less infuriating.
