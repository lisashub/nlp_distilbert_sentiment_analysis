I give this 1 star out of 10.A friend of my loaned me his screener copy and I watched it for about half and hour or so before I fell asleep. I mean, what is this crap? The story is about a sea captain who is like Jacque Cousteou or some sort, trying to find some sea creature that ate his friend. This was so boring I could not believe it. I like art house movies but this is plain stupid. The biggest disappoint for me is Bill Murray's career. What happened to him? He came out in Caddyshack and was one of the first cast members of Saturday Night Live! Do you become not funny as you grow older or is he just bad in choosing his script? I have no clue but I talked to that friend who loaned me his screener copy and his response to my question is that Bill Murray is trying to be like Tom Hanks, someone who has done both comedy and serious acting, with critical acclaim. All I can say is he should return to his comedic roots; if not, try to pick a better script.
