I like Wes Anderson films - I enjoyed Royal Tennanbaums and Rushmore. They both had a strange quality to them, with this weird alterna music that appealed to me. I HATED this movie. His movies are becoming almost formulaic - Anderson attempts to do the same thing he's done in all his movies, and this time it fails horribly. The characters lack emotion and the story is boring to watch. The father-son relationship that is established is eye-rolling bad, and the ending is unsatisfying. PLUS Anderson's directing and editing is sloppy - his shots are imperfect, imbalanced, and distracting. Example: In one scene you see Kate Blanchett's character interviewing Bill Murray - in the background there is a kitten. Every time they show Bill Murray that cat is in some different spot, or not visible at all! I have no idea what Murray was talking about because the poor directing made me lose focus. Or maybe it was shot that way on purpose - but that seems really stupid to me. I went with three others to this film, and we were all hugely disappointed with it. So were most other theatergoers I heard when we walked out. This time around, I just didn't 'get it.' BEWARE! Especially if you didn't like other Anderson films.
