i didn't get this movie and i don't know why so many people like it, its stupid. wes anderson has only directed one good film, the royal tennebaums, and this movie isn't near as good. its supposed to be a comedy? i saw more action in it than comedy, there wasn't one joke to where i laughed at. i have no clue why so many people like it, maybe some people like watching unfunny "comedies." the acting was good, but there was no jokes at ALL!!! i don't know if it is Wes Andersons imagination or what, the fish looked like crap. it made no sense, it wasn't funny, it was just a story about a guy trying to kill the shark that ate his friend, and it is all bunched up into a movie and it is god awful, stay away from this movie. it isn't funny at all. if you want something funny then watch a night at the roxbury, bad santa, AIRPLANE!, sixteen candles or harold and kumar, this movie i assure you, you will not like.
