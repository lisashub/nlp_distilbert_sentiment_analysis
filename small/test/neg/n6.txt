I'm not talking about the cartoon-like animation either. I'm talking about how high this movie climbs on the stupid scale. It seems like nothing more than a series of unrelated skits tied together by Bill Murray, playing an egotistical bore (Steve Zissou). Watching Zissou and his not so bright son (Owen Wilson) becomes redundant. Watching the nice cast being totally wasted is almost criminal. The fake accents by Wilson and Willem Dafoe are downright annoying. "The Life Aquatic" tries for dark humor but fails miserably. A "Ren and Stimpy" cartoon has more laughs than this mess. I'm sorry, I like "The Royal Tennenbaums", but "The Life Aquatic" is a big disappointment. - MERK
