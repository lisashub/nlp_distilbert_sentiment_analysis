Quintessential Wes Anderson follows the life of fallen aquatic icon Steve Zissou (Bill Murray), who is an apparent homage to Jacques-Yves Cousteau and his famous marine society. While filming another oceanographic documentary, eagerly awaiting by the public, despite the increasingly critical reaction of once ever-faithful viewers, an almost mythical Jaguar shark consumes Esteban, Zissou's best friend and confidant. Set on the destruction of the shark he venture on his research vessel Belafonte to document this feat. Before embarking Steve Zissou comes across Ned Plimpton (Owen Wilson), who presents himself as his unknown son. After joining "Team Zissou", which amongst others include second-in-command Klaus Daimler (Willem Dafoe), his wife Eleanor (Anjelica Huston), Sikh cameraman Vikram Ray (Waris Ahluwalia) and a host of unpaid college interns. Accompanying them is journalist Jane Winslett-Richardson (Cate Blanchett), come to chronicle the ill-fated voyage. Their direst foe is Alistair Hennessey (Jeff Goldblum), the current golden boy of the oceanographic community, currently going from success to success. An almost peremptory respect for Wes Anderson is almost expected from movie aficionados, but despite best intent almost every watching of quirkiness heavy and goofy populated universes of the director invariably are irritable due to the unconvincing absurdist humour, self-referential love affair with his own on-screen weirdness. Practically the only occasion where the much loved Bill Murray is entirely unwatchable. Eccentricity of characters often feels like the sole idea for plotting in an Anderson movie, making audiences interested in something other than quack-pots with odd posturing, reactions and logic detach themselves from any viewing pleasure. Giving Wes Anderson every chance in the world to catch on only one or two pictures made by him have turned out to be watchable, while the remainder seemed like senseless homework for cinephiles. "The Aquatic Life of Steve Zissou" sadly falls into the latter pool of Anderson movies. At times surrealist, at times cartoonish, including a plastic underwater world populated by colourful and odd creatures. Overly forced, partially plot less (albeit this is something of a norm for Wes Anderson) the feature has an artificial feel which permeates throughout, while personally vexatious characters make the viewing pleasure even more questionable. The deadpan delivery of jokes isn't as cool as Wes Anderson believes them to be, instead with each new movie feels increasingly fixed in mannerism.
