i've heard here that this movie isn't meant to be a comedy. OK... so it's meant to be a semi-serious movie inspired by jacques cousteau then? if that's the case then someone that is into diving might enjoy it?... no. why? because it's boring. the script is nearly non existent at times, the editing slow and dull. the visuals uninspiring people that say this isn't meant to be a comedy are surely wrong then. clearly this is meant to be a tongue in cheek movie, all of zissou's crew hang around in identical orange coloured beanies. and they have matching pyjamas. the underwater life is intentionally made to look weird and very unreal and the whole movie in fact is made to have a twilight zone quality to it mainly what this movie fails to realise is that to someone like Cousteau, the underwater world was everything. and so concentrating on land based complications such as marital issues etc is missing the point entirely. everything would have been organised around what dive site to explore next. the movie therefore completely fails to capture the enthusiasm that a character like zissou/cousteau would have for that world and as a result its core is totally off base overall i think wes anderson is quite overrated as a director, and although i like him a lot murray is also overrated as a serious actor. only dafoe here hints at what this movie could have been like under the right comedic direction overall the concept is poorly executed and doesn't make for enjoyable viewing. maybe on paper this movie looked great. perhaps even commercial... it clearly did or else it wouldn't have been backed by Disney. however it hasn't been given the treatment it deserves and falls flat. it sent me to sleep actually, and i'm guessing that wasn't the idea..
