With a spectacular cast, beautiful scenery, and an interesting premise, Life Aquatic would hope to be a great film. Unfortunately, the producers forgot that you also need a fluid script, and a good editor to make a good film. At least the actual film echoes the fiction in the movie of the bumbling inconsistent leadership of the project's leader. If one looks at the film in that perspective, it is a work of genius in life imitating art.

The film is weird and quirky. That is it's best quality. And if that is what you are into, then this would be a great film. The actors do a great job with the little scraps of soul that the screenwriters actually included on the page. (We assume that there was in fact a written script as there is a great cast, many of which are experienced enough to read into, and make good judgments on a script.) There is a very subtle depth to each character, but the actual interaction between the characters falls way off target, probably because it didn't exist on the page. With Bill Murray as the lead I was expecting laughs. The best I got was a mild half grunt at one of the really weak jokes. The main character, Steve Zissou smokes marijuana constantly throughout the piece. Perhaps that is what the audience should do to make this seem funny. Perhaps that is what the writers, producers, director, and crew were doing throughout the process, in the effort to make life imitate art. The cinematography is inconsistent. There are times in which the camera was shaky, like the director was going for a documentary feel, and other times the camera was rock steady. These times are not easily confused when the audience is looking through the on camera -documentary camera which is supposedly held by a middle-eastern cast member. The editing is poor as the movie is exceedingly slow paced. There are extraordinarily long gaps at the end of scenes or moments in the dialog where one can only surmise that they were going to put in a laugh track to help let the audience know where the humorous moments were to allegedly occur. The poor cinematography is also highlighted by the editing as one scene goes from shaky to solid, back and forth. If you are a Bill Murray fan, you will want to see this as he is as sarcastic as ever. But expect to be disappointed and unfulfilled by the overall lack of a plot. I'm glad I rented this, and didn't spend the eight bucks to sit through it in a theater. Then I'd really be upset.
