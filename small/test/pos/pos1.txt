With "The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou", Wes Anderson completed his troika of masterpieces, preceded by "Rushmore" and "The Royal Tenenbaums". Once again casting Bill Murray, Anderson casts him this time as burnout oceanographer Steve Zissou, who seeks revenge on a shark that killed his partner. You read that right; after all, this is from the director of the aforementioned flicks. Zissou sets up a team made up of various characters, including Ned Plimpton (Owen Wilson), who may or may not be his son. Bill Murray sort of elaborates on his "Lost in Translation" character, as a burnout on the verge of a major change, and does a great job with it. That - combined with top-notch direction from Anderson, plus great support from Wilson, Cate Blanchett, Anjelica Huston, Jeff Goldblum, Willem Dafoe, Bud Cort and Michael Gambon - make this the sort of movie that has basically no bad qualities. It's a real treat in every sense.
