The life aquatic with Steve Zissou, is a brilliantly quirky film. But I suspect it may divide audiences. Those who loved Wes Andersons other works (Rushmore, Tenenbaums) will no doubt love this progression of his unique style, it may on the other hand (despite the all-star cast) not convert any regular cinema goers to the cause. None the less I thoroughly enjoyed engrossing myself in the life of Steve the washed up undersea explorer and his band of misfit sailors. In the same way that Tim Burton used the misfit card in mars attacks (a gambler, a pharaoh, an alcoholic and Tom Jones all escaping together) you cant help but laugh as team Zissou, dressed in all their silver diving suits and red bobble hats, storm the island to rescue the banks bonds man Bill from pirates. Anderson has a way of making the ordinary extra-ordinary and visa-versa. Like when a child presents Zissou with a rainbow coloured seahorse in a bag (the kind you get fish in from the fair) twists when the bag bursts and Zissou continues his walk with the creature in a champagne glass held aloft like an Olympic torch. The attention to detail here is as vast as the cast of characters is diverse and any review wouldn't do this film justice, it is scored superbly, acted wonderfully and directed with a unique style that is unsurpassed. Anderson is defiantly at the top of his game and I look forward to what ever he chooses to do next like a child looking forward to Christmas.
