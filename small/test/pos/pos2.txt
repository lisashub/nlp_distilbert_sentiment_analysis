Steve Zissou (Bill Murray)a Jacques Cousteau-like aquatic documentarian whom has lost his prestige somewhat, goes on an expedition of revenge to kill a shark who had killed his friend and Team Zissou partner, Esteban. He has to deal with his aloof wife (Anjelica Huston), the son he didn't know of Ned (Owen Wilson), Klaus (Willem Dafoe) who's jealous of Ned, Jane (Cate Blanchett) a interview, and his chief nemesis, the supremely cocky and arrogant, Alistair (Jeff Golblum). I adore Wes Anderson pictures and he has yet to make one that is less than stellar in my eyes. All the actors are simply splendid and well done. I still like "Rushmore" more, but this is still a great movie. It not only holds up but gets better on subsequent viewings.
