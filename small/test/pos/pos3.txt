I was kind of expecting one of those arty films that make you squirm a bit as you labor through it. I was pleasantly surprised! This was a great movie. I was entranced and entertained throughout. On top of being a great movie in and of itself, so to speak, it was also whimsical, and a bit of a fantasy, with a bit of the magical. I had read from critics I respect that it was a 'valiant try', but was a flop, at the end of the day. I know perceptions and opinions vary, and I am prepared to manage that. But oh my--- how could those critics have got it so wrong? 'The Life Aquatic...' is marvelous! The critics had not been overly kind to this film. Maybe they subconsciously felt that writer/director Wes Anderson had gotten enough praise and enough critical 'help' thus far in his career, and that somehow he was due for some comeuppance? Dunno... but I LOVED this movie. The casting was grand. I am not ordinarily a big fan of Bill Murray, but I liked him here. This was, in fact, the only movie in which I found him thoroughly likable, with the possible exception of 'Caddyshack'. I don't think he's the only person in the world who could have played an intriguing Steve Zissou--- picture Johnny Depp in the role??? Depp would also have good. Although Angelica Houston would then have been miscast as his wife, but hey. The way it was cast, with the super hot Cate Blanchett, the always likable Owen Wilson, and all the other quirky characters, played by such luminaries as Jeff Goldblum, Bud Cort, and Wilhem Dafoe--- was superb! One test for a movie's goodness is the watch test. During the film I never, not once, thought of the time, nor checked my watch. And when it was over, I was a tiny bit disappointed. Oh, I was satisfied enough, but I also wished for more. Like a great party that finally comes to an end. I gave this movie a well deserved 10 out of 10.
