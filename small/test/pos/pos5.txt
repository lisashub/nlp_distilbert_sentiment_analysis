The details in the mess, the roguish camera-work, the way it feels highly personal and yet not overly composed, it may be my favourite Wes Anderson, it may be Bill Murray's best work, and it's the most deliciously creative movies I've ever seen. It's a serious character study through an irreverent cartoon lens, it's deeply, deeply poignant and filled with sadness, just like Steve Zissou himself. The film is about a man coming to the end of his usefulness, and his life, the people around him are dying and he's less in control of all that he loved, and even more so, he may have very little love left in him, at least in a conventional way. It's one of the most real approximations of life and relationships and age and the aching of human-ness I've ever seen. And it has a stop motion jaguar shark in it, and a Pirate shootout to Iggy Pop's search and destroy. The ending reminds me of death, and the compassion and sympathy and empathy that a slow death sometimes brings. I find this film bafflingly honest and unique. It's a little undiscovered, multicoloured, luminescent gem, buried deep beneath the ocean. That bit where he falls down the stairs and then props himself back up is movie perfection. A moment of something silly meaning something serious.
