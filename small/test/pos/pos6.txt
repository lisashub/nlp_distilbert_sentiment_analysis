Life Aquatic ranks up in the top five of the most original films of the year. It's a comedy, but when you laugh it might be at something you'd laugh at, or maybe not (some of the reactions and timing is so subtle, and the actors pull it off, to add humor), and it's also a drama that takes itself just serious enough to work well as entertainment. Although for one there may be flaws- not all the jokes or humor works very well on first viewing (although it could be on multiple viewings), and it's almost too much to take in all at once- there are also many pluses. For one thing writers Noah Bambauch and Wes Anderson (himself director) get out a story that is at the core fun to get into, even as it is with Anderson's trademark quirkiness with the characters. And, of course, there is a lead performance by Bill Murray that could rank with his best or worst depending on how you take his performance. Like with Lost in Translation, one could say that Murray is the key to the film's success- he's funny when he can, but he also is playing his Steve Zissou as a dramatic character as well. There's always that interesting line Anderson draws with his characters, and Murray proves that he's the kind of pulling off ironic, reactionary humor. And at the same time he's also dead-pan in his delivery- very few can pull off the 'mid-life crisis male' in a film like he can. That Anderson casts the film with a brilliant kind of notice for the right talent and for the unusual- Willem Dafoe as Zissou's right-hand man, Angelica Huston as Steve's ex-wife, Owen Wilson (who may be better than I thought, but I wasn't sure it was one of his very best) as a hit-or-miss possible for Steve's son he's never met, Jeff Goldblum as the competition, and Cate Blanchett, providing enough along with her turn in the Aviator as one of the prime female acting talents in Hollywood. Filling out the story, which I would not want to spoil aside from what was in the one-line summary, are elements that Anderson has yet to really touch upon. While there was some violence in his debut Bottle Rocket, here he takes it another step where there are a couple of enthralling action sequences (one of which incorporating The Stooges' Search and Destroy), where it's filmed is intriguing as well, how it's paced. Not to mention French acoustical covers of David Bowie, and wonderful Animation set pieces by Henry (Nightmare Before Christmas) Sellick... it's very good, if not great, film-making overall, and if you cant catch it in the theater, it's of good worth to watch with friends on DVD.
