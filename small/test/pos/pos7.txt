Every Movie Buff knows that You need Dynamite to Kill a Shark. So with Sticks on board, We're off to Find the Killer Fish, through the wonderful Visionary World of Director Wes Anderson. His Sharp Eye, like always, is a Hyper Focused, Multi-Colored, Surreal, Symmetrical look at the World that is Vibrating on a slightly Different Frequency than that of regular Folks. As the Film Drifts through Uncharted Seas on a broken down Boat, everything seems somewhat Uncomfortable and Edgy, slightly Out of Step, but is always In Tune with its own Symphony of Oddball Characters and even Odder Sea Creatures. It is a Stunning Display of Artful Imaginings with a Shallow Story line but with a Depth of Emotion that can't help but draw You into its own place of Meticulously Placed Actors and Props that are Posed to posses with an Artificial Attraction that says, "This is real but not really". That is Wes Anderson, take it or leave it. The Pacing is at times Ponderous, but it never lingers enough to bring on Boredom, and it is forever Fascinating Visually. If there is one great Flaw, it is the Overuse of the acoustic Portuguese Language Bowie Songs. It is a Quirk that wears Thin very fast and the thread is Woven into the Film regularly and it is a slight Burden to Bare if Not fully Embraced.
