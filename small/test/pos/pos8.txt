Such a beautiful unique colorful gem of Wes Anderson's! It seems a bit misunderstood by some which is fair it's a odd one but lovable! Lots of amazing set designs, incredible cinematography, very vibrant colors, and great soundtrack. Not like most shark hunt adventures kind of an acquired taste for Wes Anderson fans or similar. Also I think it's cool that I'm the 666th person to review the film.
