The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou is reliably incredible work from Wes Anderson that's unpredictable, really funny and meta. Bill Murray is perfect in the lead role and Willem Dafoe, Owen Wilson, Cate Blanchett, Angelica Huston and Jeff Goldblum are all incredible. Wes Anderson's direction is superb, it's colorful and beautifully filmed. The set design is excellent and both the music by Mark Mothersbaugh and the soundtrack are amazing.
